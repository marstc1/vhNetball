            Victoria’s festival will take place on Saturday 29th June 2020. The
            closing date for entries is the 16th June – unless places fill
            earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The day will be split into 2 parts – the morning session we will be
            hosting a fun tournament for teams who don’t normally play netball
            and fancy some fun whilst playing the sport that Vicky loved. This
            year we have decided to cap teams to a maximum of 2 affiliated
            netballers per team.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can’t get a team together but would love to play, then get in
            touch and we will try and pull a team together for you!
          </p>
          <p>
            The afternoon tournament will be for affiliated players/teams who
            play netball. You will be required to provide an umpire at the
            appropriate level as detailed below. All of these games should be
            “friendly” but “competitive”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Numbers are limited and entry is on a first come first served basis.
