            <p>
              We have booked the 25th June 2022 at City Academy and plan to
              approach the day as previous years following any additional COVID
              precautions as per government guidelines at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the roadmap dates change and we need to reschedule then we will
              do so with a date in September, teams will be able to keep their
              place or if the date doesnâ€™t work can get their entry fee refunded
              if notified within 7 days of the new date being announced.
            </p>
